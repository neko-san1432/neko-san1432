<summary><h2>🧭Pyrrhus's Programming Journey</h2></summary>
I started coding during the 8th grade when we got a topic about programming and stuff. At that time, I thought HTML was a programming language but it wasn't. It was just a language used to create an interactive and attractive interface on web pages. But still, I was amazed by the power of HTML at that time. In my grade 11, things started changing. We learned C++, and I wasn't quite amazed because of its complex syntax and the repetitive topics (like the fundamentals). However in 12th grade, I realized that it is important to master the basics of programming, and also the learnings from my grade 11 were not useless at all. And now, I am still learning more languages and logic. I keep practicing more and more to provide a good contribution to our technological world.
